# ReactJS Animation Basics

This repo is a fork of https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/reactjs-css-animation-basics by the amazingly talented Max Schwarzm√ºller where he details animation in React. It has accompanying videos starting at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztvNwFV0Ai0&t=11s.

I have updated his repo by making all the branches separate components and using the navigation (w/ react-router) to show the different demos all within one app.

# Usage
Navigate between the different sections of the app to see examples of different implementations of animations within React
